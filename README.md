# Global COVID Trends from Janurary 2020 to November 2022

The purpose of this project was to examine trends and patterns across the globe in relation to the spread of COVID, deaths relating to the illness, and vaccinations. Within this repository you will find a copy of the raw data, copies of the cleaned and seperated data sets (Deaths and Vaccinations), a SQL script with all queries used during this project, a markdown file used to explain the queries, a Jupyter notebook of my markdown file, and a link to my [Global COVID Trends dashbord on Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/megan.schlebecker/viz/GlobalCOVIDTrendsJan20-Nov22/GlobalCOVIDTrends).
